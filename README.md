## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   You can clone this repository using Git by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lict99/PLT_Cancer_Survival.git
   ```

   Alternatively, you can download the repository manually from GitHub.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Inside the repository, you'll find a file named `renv.lock`, which contains the versions of R and required packages. Ensure that you have the `renv` package installed in your R environment. Then, run the following R command to restore the project's dependencies:

   ```R
   renv::restore()
   ```
   
3. **Execute the R Scripts:**
